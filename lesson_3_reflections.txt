When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I'd use a remote repository when working on a project with multiple team members.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because when you manually pull changes you're aware of what you're pulling to your local repository and if the sync was automatic, you may pull some unwanted changes to your repo or be unaware of what are the changes about.
